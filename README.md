# UWPAppSkeleton
Project Template for an MMVM Light Universal App

This here is the basis Visual Studio project template that will create the skeleton of an app that looks and feels a lot like the built in Microsoft Windows 10 app (Weather, NFL etc). It's got all the basic stuff plumbed out like navigation and a navigation control, a settings page, Theme switch etc.

There is a [Visual Studio extensibility package](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/909387a1-1483-4637-b536-f36692c0bc88) up on the community site.

If you use MVVM Light the resulting project code will look pretty familiar, and there are some TODO comments to show where to plug in the specifics for your app.
